	Let \(R\) be a standard graded polynomial ring and let \(I\) be a homogenous
prime ideal of \(R\). Bhatt, Blickle, Lyubeznik, Singh, and Zhang examined
the local cohomology of \(R/I^t\) as \(t\) grows arbitrarily large. I will
discuss their results and give an explicit description of the transition
maps between these local cohomology modules in a particular example.
I will also consider asymptotic structure in a different direction:
as the number of variables of \(R\) grows. This study of families of
modules over compatible varying rings hints at the existence of FI
structures.

	 In this talk we will introduce trimming complexes and explore

	 some structure theory for certain classes of grade 3 homogeneous
	 ideals defining compressed rings, which can be used to construct
	 ideals of arbitrarily large type with Tor-algebra class G.
	 Moreover, we are able to produce explicit Betti tables for a
	 subfamily of so-called determinantal facet ideals.

      <div class="panel-body">
	Geometric vertex decomposition (a degeneration technique) and
	liaison are two frameworks that have been used to produce similar
	results about similar families of algebraic varieties.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will connect these two approaches. In particular, I will
show that each geometrically vertex decomposable ideal is linked by a
sequence of ascending elementary G-biliaisons of height 1 to an ideal of
indeterminates and, conversely, that each elementary G-biliaison of a
certain type gives rise to a geometric vertex decomposition. As a
consequence, I will show that several well-known families of ideals are
glicci.

	When S is a ring of prime characteristic p > 0, the local cohomology

	S is singular, but retain the notion of Frobenius actions. In this
	talk, we will present recent joint work with Eric Canton on some
	advantages to using a non-standard Frobenius action, defined when S
	is a complete intersection ring, and will discuss applications to
	questions about finiteness properties.

<b>Kevin Tucker - On some permanence properties of (derived) splinters</b></a>
      </h4>

    <div id="collapse22" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
	Perhaps owing to their simple definition, basic questions about splinters are often devilishly difficult to answer. Following
André’s celebrated proof of Hochster’s direct summand conjecture, it is natural to ask whether splinters satisfy some
basic permanence properties enjoyed by other classes of singularities. We show that Noetherian splinters ascend under
essentially étale homomorphisms. Along the way, we also prove that the henselization of a Noetherian local splinter
is always a splinter and that the completion of a local splinter with geometrically regular formal fibers is a splinter.
Finally, we give an example of a (non-excellent) Gorenstein local splinter with mild singularities whose completion is not
a splinter. This talk is based on joint work with Rankeya Datta.

	In this talk I will describe how the related notions of closure

	explain some of the theory connecting these ideas and give a number
	of computed examples.
