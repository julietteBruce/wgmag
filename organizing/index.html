From past experiences I understand the importance of trying to organize conferences and events that are inclusive and supportive of all individuals. 
When organizing events I do my best to keep this in mind. If you'd like to discuss ways conferences can be made more inclusive and welcoming, or
would like to tell me ways I can do better as an organizer, please feel free to contact me. 

<h3>Math Circles</h3>
<p>
In addition to my volunteer work (see my Outreach page) I have also been involved as an organizer with
both the Madison and Michigan math circles.
</p>
<!-- 
<p>I am a one of student organizers of the <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Madison_Math_Circle">Madison Math Circle</a>, which seeks to cultivate an excitement and passion for mathematics in middle and high school students. One of my goals in working with this organization is broadening its reach and impact. We have worked towards this by beginning to hold meetings off campus at local schools and partnering with other community organizations.
Previously I was involved as an volunteer and student organizer of the <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathcircle/">Michigan Math Circle</a>.</p>
 -->
<ul>
<li>Student Organizer, <a href="ttps://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Madison_Math_Circle">Madison Math Circle</a> &ndash; (Winter 2016 - Winter 2018)</li>
<li>Student Organizer, <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathcircle/">Michigan Math Circle</a> &ndash; (Winter 2013 - Summer 2014)</li>
</ul>
In these positions I have worked to broadening the reach and impact of these circles. 
For example, with the Madison Math Circle I have helped expand the circles programing by beginning to hold  
off-campus meetings at local schools and partnering with other community organizations.
