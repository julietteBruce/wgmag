<p>
My research interests lie in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra,
and arithmetic geometry. In particular, I am interested in using
homological methods to study the geometry of zero loci of systems of
polynomials (i.e. algebraic varieties). I am also interested in studying
the arithmetic properties of varieties over finite fields. Further, I am
passionate about promoting inclusivity, diversity, and justice in math.

		We study systems of parameters over finite fields from a probabilistic perspective. Our central technique is an adaptation of Poonen's closed point sieve, where we sieve over higher dimensional subvarieties, and we express the desired probabilities via a zeta function-like power series that enumerates higher dimensional varieties instead of closed points. Applications include an effective Noether normalization result over a finite field, and a new proof of a recent result of Gabber-Liu-Lorenzini and Chinburg-Moret-Bailly-Pappas-Taylor on uniform Noether normalizations for projective families over the integers. <font color="#0088CC">Last updated: 9/21/17, 20 pages.</font>

		<div id="abelian-varieties" class="collapse">
		We show that any polarized abelian variety over a finite field is covered by a Jacobian whose dimension is bounded by an explicit constant. We do this by first proving an effective version of Poonen's Bertini theorem over finite fields, which allows us to show the existence of smooth curves arising as hypersurface sections of bounded degree and genus. Additionally, we show that for simple abelian varieties a better bound is possible. As an application of these results we show that if \(E\) is an elliptic curve over a finite field then for any \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) there exist smooth curves of bounded genus whose Jacobians have a factor isogenous to \(E^n\)

		We formulate several conjectures which shed light on the structure of Veronese syzygies of projective spaces. Our conjectures are based on experimental data that we derived by developing a numerical linear algebra and distributed computation technique for computing and synthesizing new cases of Veronese embeddings for \(\mathbb{P}^2\). <font color="#0088CC">Last updated: 11/9/17, 25 pages.</font>

		We provide a closed formula for the degree of \(\text{SO}(n)\) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In addition, we describe symbolic and numerical techniques which can also be used to compute the degree of \(\text{SO}(n)\) for small values of \(n\). As an application of our results, we give a formula for the number of critical points of a low-rank semidefinite programming optimization problem.

		This paper explores the relationship between real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\), the resolution of cusp singularities, and continued fractions. It is shown that up to equivalence there is a one to one correspondence between real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\) and continued fraction expansions of real numbers between zero and one. This relationship with continued fractions is then used to provide a characterization of the valuation rings for real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\). In the case when the monomial valuation is equivalent to an integral monomial valuation, we exhibit explicit generators of the valuation rings. Finally, we demonstrate that if v is a monomial valuation such that \(\nu(x)=a\) and \(\nu(y)=b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime positive integers larger than one, then \(\nu\) governs a resolution of the singularities of the plane curve \(x^b=y^a\) in a way we make explicit. Further, we provide an exact bound on the number of blow ups needed to resolve singularities in terms of the continued fraction of \(a/b\). <font color="#0088CC">Last updated: 1/14/16, 28 pages.</font>

		The goal of this note is to quantitatively study the behavior of asymptotic
syzygies for certain toric surfaces, including Hirzebruch surfaces. In
particular, we show that the asymptotic linear syzygies of Hirzebruch surfaces
embedded by \(\mathcal{O}(d,2)\) conform to Ein, Erman, and Lazarsfeld's
normality heuristic. We also show that the higher degree asymptotic syzygies
are not asymptotically normally distributed.

We study the asymptotic non-vanishing of syzygies for products of
projective spaces. Generalizing the monomial methods of Ein, Erman, and
Lazarsfeld \cite{einErmanLazarsfeld16} we give an explicit range in
which the graded Betti numbers of \(\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times \mathbb{P}^{n_2}\) embedded by
\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{P}^{n_2}}(d_1,d_2)\) are non-zero. These bounds
provide the first example of how the asymptotic syzygies of a smooth
projective variety whose embedding line bundle grows in a semi-ample
fashion behave in nuanced and previously unseen ways. 		</div>
